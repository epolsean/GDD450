Instructions:
Run executable in the main game folder.

Use the mouse for all the basic controls. Click on a single hexagon to bring up a UI for building.
When hovering over a tower hold the 'f' key and click to switch to first person, click 'f' again to return
to third person. When in first person aim with the mouse and press space bar to shoot.
Currently just clicking on a turret will upgrade it if it can be upgraded.

Resources:
The squares on the right side of the scene are currently to put buildings that gather resources.
Holding the keys '1', '2', or '3' and clicking on one of the squares will build a corresponding building.

Objective:
Build towers and walls to stop and defeat the enemies during each wave. Click the start wave button to star each wave.
Don't lose all your lives, doing so will result in a loss. Letting one enemy through takes away one life.
